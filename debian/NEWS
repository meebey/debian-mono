mono (1.2.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Here we go, Mono 1.2 is now official stable and released!

  * Mono 1.2 brings alot of new features in:
    - The C# 2.0 compiler is now stable, and the ECMA standard was updated, so
      it's safe to use C# 2.0 (gmcs) now. _But_ the 2.0 API is not complete, thus
      there are classes/methods still missing.
    - Mono is now officially supported on the following architectures:
      + 32bit: i386, powerpc, arm, s390, sparc.
      + 64bit: amd64, s390x, ia64.
      The debian packages are available for: i386, powerpc arm, amd64 and ia64.
      Packages for s390, s390x, sparc and kfreebsd-i386 are under review, when
      the ports are prooved to be stable enough, we will include them.
    - Complete System.Windows.Forms 1.1 API
      This version is not using wine! SWF runs natively on Linux (X11 driver)
      using an own implementation (libgdiplus).
    - File System Watching API now supports inotify.

mono (0.96-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * It has been quite a while since the last Mono release in Debian and
    we feel that it's time to announce few things changed in the
    meantime:

 - dependencies management and debhelper integration - the new
   mono-utils package contains scripts to create and manage dependencies
   between the .NET library packages.  They work in a similar way to the
   .shlibs system in Debian. For more details, see dh_makenetlibs(1),
   dh_netdeps(1) and monodoc's rules file as example.
   Another script available now is dh_installxsp which will install
   snippets of configuration files for XSP packages (HTML/ASP.NET server
   and Apache module).

 - the GAC - except of mscorlib.dll, all DLLs are moved into
   /usr/share/dotnet hierarchy and are now loaded using the GAC (Global
   Assembly Cache) method. This also makes sane versioning possible,
   similar to SONAME handling on native shared libraries.
 
 - see README.Debian for further details about changes and the current
   .NET Debian policy
